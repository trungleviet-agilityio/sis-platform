# /sis-team:plan

Phase: `$ARGUMENTS` (ask for it if empty).

1. Read the repo's `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/adr/*.md` (the first ADR holds the phase list). Read the phase in the
   working plan if there is one (kept outside the repo; its path is in `CLAUDE.local.md`). If the phase
   depends on an input still marked `TODO`, ask the owner for it now. Without a working plan, ask the owner
   for the phase scope.
2. Spawn `sis-team:solution-architect` with: the phase number, its requirement or decision IDs, the list of
   existing ADRs, and the answers from step 1.
3. Save the returned ADR as `docs/adr/NNNN-phase-<n>-<slug>.md` (next free number, status `proposed`). Keep
   the build briefs in the same file under `## Build briefs`.
4. Show the owner a short summary: the decisions, open questions, and what they will run by hand at the
   checkpoint. Ask them to approve (status becomes `accepted`) or change it.
5. Stop. Do not start building in this skill.
